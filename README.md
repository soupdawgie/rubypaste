##Rubypaste

Rubypaste is a snippet storage for the code written (as you might guess) in Rubyâ€”with the syntax highlighting in the manner of beautiful **Monokai** theme.

Made for the sake of exercising and getting my hands dirty in some JS (more specifically in the [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) script set).

Built with [Ruby 2.2.4](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) on [Rails 4.2.2](http://rubyonrails.org/).
