##Rubypaste

Rubypaste is a snippet storage for the code written (as you might guess) in Rubyâ€”with the syntax highlighting in the manner of beautiful **Monokai** theme.

Made for the sake of exercise, skill testing and getting my hands dirty in some JS (more specifically in the [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) script set).
